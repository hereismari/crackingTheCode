# Stock Data


## Information

* Service: end-of-day stock price information (open, close, high, low)
* Client Apps: 1000
* Responsabilites: rollout, ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the feed.
* We already have data in any format we want.

## Decisions

1. How to store the data?

## Proposals

1. Text files

    * Pros:
        * Easy to offer
    * Cons:
        * Hard to query
        * Easy to break

2. SQL Database

    * Pros:
        * Reuse performance implementation from SQL
        * Easy to query
    * Cons:
        * Safety issues: what if a client has wrong permissions?
        * Efficience issues: what if a client performs a lot
          of heavy computations that can lead the server to be
          inefficient.
        * Probably more than we need.
        * Not easily readable by humans.
3. XML or JSON

    * Pros:
        * Easy to offer
        * Not so easy to query, but easier than a text file
    * Cons:
        * Easy to read
        * To query it, you need to load the entire file
