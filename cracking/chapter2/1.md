## Remove all dups

Considering that no temporary buffer is allowed
(if we could use a buffer we could use a hashmap or a set so we could remove all dups in O(n)
time efficiency and O(n) memory)....

We have to do it in O(nÂ²) time, why? Because if when we are at a certain position of
the linked list we can't verify in O(1) if this particular element happened before
:(, so we have to look in the linked list which is O(n).

What we can do is start in the head, walk trough the linked list
removing dups (except the head), then do it for the next
element, then for the next one... and so on!
