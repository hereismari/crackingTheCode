## Sparse Search

If we had no empty strings in the array we could use a binary search and 
everything would be ok. Because of the spaces in arbitrary locations of the
array we can't make a binary search, so the worst case solution will have to be
O(n). We can still change a binary search approach and if we have luck it
will be a lot better than O(n).

##### Not Implemented because is pretty straight foward
