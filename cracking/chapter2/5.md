## Sum Lists

# Case 1

If the digits are stored in reverse order is easy to come up with a solution. 
Sum digit by digit (just moving pointers trough the linked list) and keep 
track if the sum doesn't fit at just one digit.

O(n) efficiency and O(n) memory.

# Case 2

If the digits are not stored in the original order, maybe a good approach is 
to make a recursive function to add them up, so we can keep track of if the
sum doesn't fit. If we had an array we could just walk trought it backwards
but in the linked list we don't have this possibility, so maybe it was a good
thing thinking about refactoring our code in this situation.
but first we need to know the size of both linked lists.

Knowing the size of both linked lists we will be able to know where to start
to sum up them.

Example:

    1 -> 2 -> 3
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

    We should sum:
          123
      + 12321
        -----
        12444

    So we must start to sum the digits at the index 2 of the biggest linked
    list.

O(n) efficiency and O(n) + recursion stack memory.
