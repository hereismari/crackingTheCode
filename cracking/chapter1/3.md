Well, this is a "simple" problem talking about efficienty because is obviously O(n). The problem is more about how to implement it.
We can use a queue to help us. This will help us do the algorithm in O(n) storing the values that must be "shifted".

We actually don't need to use the queue if we pre-calculate the number of spaces in the sentence and start in the "end" of the new string :)
