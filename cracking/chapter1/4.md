## Palindrome Permutation

The idea for the soultion is similar to what we've already seen
in the first problems. For a string to "swapped" into a palindrome
it needs to have the an even ammount of characters *c*  or at maximum one
odd number of some *c*.

### changing the string

Sort the string (changing it) and verify if each letter in it
appears a even number of times and only one of them appears an odd number.

### using additional memory

Use an additional array of size 256 (ASC II) and count the number
of occurence of each letter. if there is more than one letter that
has an odd number of occurences then is not true that it is an palidrome permutation.
