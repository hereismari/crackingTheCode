## Is Unique

There is a small number of possible characters (ASC II -> 256), so using an auxiliary data structure to count the number
of occurrences of a char is a good alternative.

This solution will uses a ~ O(256) ~ O(300) memory complexity and a O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string.

An in place solution is to sort the data (O(nlogn) using merge/quick sort, quick is better because no auxiliary data
structure is needed) and then compare each element with the previous one.

Other solution is to compare each element with time complexity of O(nÂ²).
