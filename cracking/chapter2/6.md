## Palindrome

So, if a linked list is a palindrome the first element must be equal to
the last element, the second element should be equal to the last-second 
element... and so on...

So, in the linked list we can't compare in a easy way the first and
last element. So a valid approach is to copy the linked list to a new one
where the elements are in reverse order.

And then just compare the linked lists. This would O(n) efficient in time, 
and O(n) efficient in memory + recursion stack.

Maybe we can try to use less memory... we can implement a easy O(nÂ²) solution
that doesn't uses any additiona memory.
