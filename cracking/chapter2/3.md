## Remove middle element

# To find the middle:
O(n): We can use a two pointes approach like this:

    - at the beginning the pointers, t1, t2, are pointing to the head
    - then, everytime t2 walks 2 times, t1 walks 1 time. If t2 == NULL, t1 will be at the half of the list :)

# Remove an element without having the linked list
O(1): just copy the data of the next node for this node, then remove the next one. Of course, check if the next one is different from NULL.
