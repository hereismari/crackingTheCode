## Problem

How to find the shortest path between two people in a very large
social network like Facebook or Linkedin?

## Proposals

### Small scale solution

Bidirectional search using BFS on the graph.

### Large scale solution

The database will be distributed between multiple shards, we can hash
the users ID to know in which shard their graph node is stored.

Than we can do a bidirectional search using the BFS, since BFS
can be easily prallelized, since one BFS doesn't need the others one.

And we can have a main job that will kill all the other processes
(threads) once one of these threads find the shortest path.

### Follow up questions

1. What if some server fails?

We can have some kind of timer to wait until some process find the path.
After the time limit we just kill and restart again once the servers are up.

We can also can have some health check on which node and before doing the 
BFS there we can check if the machine is up to avoid problems. If during
the BFS the machine is down, we know that we need to restart the bfs in the 
node it was running before it died.

2. How to take advantage of caching?

Use cach to store the last asked min-short nodes. And use these
values for other BFSs as well.

3. How to decide when to give up?

If someone else found it.

4. In real life, some nodes will have more friends, how to use this?

Instead of a queue, use a priority queue using the number of friends
as a factor.
