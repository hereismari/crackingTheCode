## Palindrome Permutation

The idea to this problem is similar to what we have already seen in the three first problems. We can make 2 approches:
    
    1. Sort the string (changing it) and verify if each letter in it appears a even number of times and only one of them appears an odd number
    2. Use an additional array of size 256 (ASC II) and count the number of occurence of each letter. if there is more than one letter that
       has an odd number of occurences then is not true that it is an palidrome permutation
