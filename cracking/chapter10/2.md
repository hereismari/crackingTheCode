## Group Anagrams

### Solution 1

We can implement a comparator that checks
if they are anagram and use it
at some classic algorithm like mergesort.

O(n * k * logn), n is the number of strings
and k is the size of the biggest string.


### Solution 2

We can also use a hashmap to sort the strings
and use as keys to the hashmap that stores
their indexes.

This will use O(n) additional memory, and will have
time efficiency of O(nlogn).
