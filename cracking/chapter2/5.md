## Sum Lists

# Case 1

If the digits are stored in reverse order is easy to come up with a solution. Sum digit by digit (just moving pointers trough the linked list) and keep track if the sum doesn't fit at just one digit.

O(n) efficiency and O(n) memory.

# Case 2

If the digits are not stored in reverse order, maybe a good approach is make a recursive function to add them up, but first we need to know the size of both linked lists.

O(n) efficiency and O(n) + recursion stack memory.
