## Palindrome

So, if a linked list is a palindrome the first
element must be equal to the last element, the
second element should be equal to the last-second 
element and so on...

In the linked list we can't compare in a easy
way the first and last element. So a valid approach
is to copy the linked list to a new one
where the elements are in reverse order.

And then just compare the linked lists.
This would O(n) efficient in time, and O(n) in  memory.

Maybe we can try to use less memory...
we can implement a easy O(nÂ²) solution that doesn't
use any additional memory.
