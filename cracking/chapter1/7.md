## Rotate Matrix

The idea for the solution is that the same pattern is executed
for each submatrix in the big matrix. Recursion can be used,
but a iteractive approach is possible and easy to implement.

See the implementation for details, since the problem is clear.

Efficiency is O(NÂ²), and the additional memory used is constant.
