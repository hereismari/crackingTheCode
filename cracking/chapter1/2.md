## Check Permutation

There are two aparently good solutions:

    1. You can sort both strings and compare them. This solution is going to have time complexity O(nlogn) and O(1) memory complexity
       (supposing we can change the original strings)
    2. You can use two additionals arrays of size 256 (ASC II) and compare them. This solution is going to have time complexity O(n)
       , but memory complexity O(256).
