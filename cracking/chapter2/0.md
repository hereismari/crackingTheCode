## Remove ALL

No temporary buffer is allowed. But that's not exactlly a problem we can solve this with O(1) memory complexity and O(n) time complexity with a simple code.
What we do is just pass trough the structure. If we find the element we want to remove, just remove it! But careful:

    - If the head is equal to the element we should make: head = it.next; it.previous = null;
    - Otherwise just remove it, maybe a second pointer will help with this task :)
        
        linked1 = 3 --> 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 3 --> 2 --> 3

        Let's remove 3 from linked1;

        1. while the head equals to 3, remove head
        2. Pass trough the linked list and remove element
            
            So... if we are iterating with 2 pointers, it1 and it2, where it2 is it1.next and it2.data = 3
            it1.next = it2.next;
