Talking about efficienty we can have a O(n) solution. The problem is more about the implementation.

### Using additional memory

We can use a queue to help us. We'll store the values that must be "shifted", and use this to update the string as well.
Using O(n) additional memory.

### Not using additional memory

We can calculate the "real" string length and then go backwards in the string "shifting" the chars to the end, and changing the spaces when needed.
