## Intersection

We can see that if two linked lists intercept then the tail node will
for sure be the same at both linked lists. Another thing we can notice is
that if we have 2 linked lists with size M and N. if M > N then in the first
M-N nodes for sure there is no interception, so we can "skip" theses nodes
and just keep updating the pointers at the following nodes.

This will be O(N + M) time efficient, and no additional memory will be needed.
