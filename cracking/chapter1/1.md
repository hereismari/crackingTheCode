## Is Unique

### Not in place solution

There is a small number of possible characters (ASC II -> 256), so using an
auxiliary data structure (array or dictionary) to count the number of occurrences
of a char is a good alternative.

This solution will uses a ~ O(256) memory complexity which is constant and a
O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string.

## In place solution but changing the original string

An in place solution is to sort the data (O(nlogn) using quick sort,
no auxiliary data structure is needed) and then compare each element
with the previous one (from 1 to length(str)-1).

## In place solution not changing the original string

Other solution is to compare every element with each other,
time complexity of O(nÂ²).
