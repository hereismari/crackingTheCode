## Sparse Search

If we had no empty strings in the array we
could use a binary search. Because of the
spaces in arbitrary locations of the array we
can't make a binary search, so the worst
case solution will be O(n).


We can still change a binary search approach
and if we have luck it will be a lot better
than O(n).
