## One Away

Okay, so denoting s (original string) and t (string after edits) we can see that:
    
   1. If a character was removed then len(s) = len(t) + 1.
      And if we iterate trought t, the first time that s[i] != t[i]
      implies that t[i] = s[i] + 1, if there are no
      different characters the removed char was the last one from s.
    
   2. If a character was inserted then len(s) = len(t) - 1.
      And if we iterate trought t, the first time that s[i] != t[i]
      implies that t[i+1] = s[i], if there are no different
      characters the char was added in the end of the string s.

   3. If a character was replaced the len(s) = len(t). And if
      we iterate trought t, there can only be one different
      character (s[i] != t[i]).
