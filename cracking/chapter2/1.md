## Remove all dups

No temporary buffer is allowed. And  that's gonna actually impact in your solution because if we could use a hashmap or hashtable we could remove all dups in O(n) time efficiency and O(n) memory efficiency. But now, we have to do it in O(nÂ²) time, why? Because when we are at a certain position of the linked list we can't verify in O(1) if this element happened before :(, so we have to look in the linked list (O(n)).

What we can do is pretty simple, just start in the head, walk trough the linked list removing dups (except the head), then do it for the next element, then for the next one... and so on!
