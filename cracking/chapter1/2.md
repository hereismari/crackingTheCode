## Check Permutation


## Changing the strings

Sort both strings and check if they are equal. Complexity is O(nlogn) and O(1) additional memory.

## Not changing the strings, but using additional memory

You can use two additionals arrays of size 256 (ASC II) and check if:

```python

cont_s = [0] * (256 + 1)
cont_t = [0] * (256 + 1)

for i in range(256 + 1):
    if cont_s[i] != cont[t]:
        return False

return True
```

Time complexity is O(n), and memory complexity O(256).

## Not changing strings and not using additional memory

Check for all possible character `c` if `s` and `t` have the same amount of `c` characters.
Time effiency is O(256 * (n + m)), where `n` is the size of `s` and `m` is the size of `t`.
