## Return Kth to Last

A solution more complicated is to use recursion, so let's do it this way, because probably the interviwer intended that we solved this way, because the iterative version is very simple.

So, we can do a recursive function that returns the kth last node, and count at witch index we are passing a counter by reference instead of by value.
